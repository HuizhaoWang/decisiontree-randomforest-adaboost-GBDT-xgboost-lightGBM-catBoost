# Illustrate decision tree and its derivatives

## 1. Decision tree, code in "decisionTree.py"

### 1.1 What is decision tree? Build an "if-elif-else" condition tree according to some certain data which contains useful information that is really used to predict for future new data;

### 1.2 How to build it, i.e. how to arange features(columns' names of "Data") on the tree, some features at first layers and others later? 

When coming to the decision tree in Fig_1, why is "outlook" on the top rather than "Humidity" or "Wind"? In the fact the top one is selected by certain algorithms, such as ID3, C4.5, Cart and so on.
