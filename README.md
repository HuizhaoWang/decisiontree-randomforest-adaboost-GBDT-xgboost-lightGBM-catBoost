# Illustrate decision tree and its derivatives

1. Decision tree, its code file is "decisionTree.py"

1.1 What is decision tree? Build a "if-elif-else" condition tree according to some certain data which contains 
useful information that is really used to predict for future new data;

1.2 How to build it, i.e. how to arange features(columns' names of "Data") on the tree, some features at first
layers or latters? Coming to the decision tree in Fig_1, why is "outlook" on the top rather than "Humidity" or "Wind"? 
In the fact the top one is selected by certain algorithms, such as ID3, C4.5, Cart and so on.
